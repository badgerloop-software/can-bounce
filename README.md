This repository is used to flash code on the CAN test board to validate data sent to the CAN bus. 

The main branch should be up-to-date with the latest template code to get you guys started with writing the tests. 

Getting Started:

1. To checkout a new branch open the terminal, `cd` into the `can-bounce` repository. 

2. While naming the branches try to follow thhe conventions. For eg. for a board's main CAN test, name it `companion_{board_name}`. Once you are in the `can-bounce` repository: To create and load into a new branch use `git checkout -b ____________` (where "`__________`" is will be the name your new branch). To load an existing branch, use `git checkout -b ____________` (where "`__________`" is will be the name the existing branch).

3. After you are done with the tests, push your branch with `git push origin __________` (where `____________` is your branch name)
